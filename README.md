logError("Failed to write to log")

Filter logs in Output and file based on minimum level (via settings)

Settings:

"localLogger.logLevel": "info" // options: info | warn | error

2. 📄 Log Export Format (Markdown / JSON / Plaintext)

Goal: Allow users to export daily logs in preferred formats.

Features:

Export formats:

txt → Plain log lines (default)

md → Markdown bullets

json → Array of { timestamp, level, message }

Settings:

"localLogger.logExportFormat": "md" // options: txt | md | json

3. 🧲 Status Bar Toggle (Logging On/Off)

Goal: Let users quickly pause/resume logging with one click.

Features:

Status bar icon:

✅ Logging ON → green icon

❌ Logging OFF → gray icon

Toggle state persists for the session

4. ☁️ Remote Sync via API / S3 / Webhook

Goal: Push logs to external storage for backup, audit, or dashboarding.

Features:

POST logs to a configured endpoint

Optional API key header

Triggered on command or automatically after daily summary

Settings:

"localLogger.remoteSync.enabled": true,
"localLogger.remoteSync.endpoint": "https://yourserver.com/api/logs",
"localLogger.remoteSync.apiKey": "sk-123abc"

🧩 Integration Strategy

Features will be modular: users can enable only what they need.

All new settings will be defined under localLogger namespace.

Backward compatible with current setup.

📌 Next Plan

Implement setting schema updates
